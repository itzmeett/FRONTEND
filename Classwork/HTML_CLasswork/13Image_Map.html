    <center><h1>Image Map</h1></center>
    <li>
      The HTML &lt;map&gt; tag defines an image map. An image map is an image
      with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more &lt;area&gt;
      tags.
    </li>
    <li>
      The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform
      different actions depending on where in the image you click
    </li>
    <li>
      The image is inserted using the &lt;img&gt; tag. The only difference from
      other images is that you must add a usemap attribute
    </li>
    <li>
      The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the
      image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the
      image map.
    </li>
