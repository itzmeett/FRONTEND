            The background-attachment CSS property sets whether a background
            image's position is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls with its
            containing block.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>

            <br />
            <div class="box bg-attachment">
              <p>
                The background is fixed relative to the viewport. Even if an

                The background is fixed relative to the element itself and does

        <ul>
          <li>
            The background-clip CSS property sets whether an element's
            background extends underneath its border box, padding box, or
            content box.
          </li>
          <br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            The background-origin CSS property sets the background's origin:
            from the border start, inside the border, or inside the padding.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for
            each background image. The position is relative to the position
            layer set by background-origin.
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The background-repeat CSS property sets how background images are
            repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal
            and vertical axes, or not repeated at all.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The background-size CSS property sets the size of the element's
            background image. The image can be left to its natural size,
            stretched, or constrained to fit the available space.
          </li>

                the element has a scrolling mechanism, the background scrolls
                with the element's contents, and the background painting area
                and background positioning area are relative to the scrollable
                area of the element rather than to the border framing them.
                <br />
                The background is fixed relative to the element itself and does
                not scroll with its contents. (It is effectively attached to the
                element's border.)
